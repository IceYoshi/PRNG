**Still left to do**:
- Get Dieharder to run on the UL HPC Platform
- Easybuild integration
- SPRNG and specific nVidia GPU implementations (cuRAND)
- Automated job launcher on the UL HPC Platform
- Benchmark and plot the generation speed along different RNGs and compare seq with mpi using different number of processes.
